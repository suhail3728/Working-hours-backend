## Effective use of javascript techniques

So I was a student in the course ``DGL 113 CVS1 2024 Winter Term``

That course was really helpful it was taught by Frank Lu, He taught CPS-100, that was my first computer science course ever and I am always grateful for bridging my undertanding and giving me a good foundation on programming techniques.
Now, during the course `DGL 113` I a lot of javascript techniques one of them is the use of `setTimeOut` funciton. This function helped me to solve on of the major issue in my project. I will explain how this function helped me, first let me give a brief description about this function 

### setTimeOut function:

So this is a javaScript buit-in function that is used to delay an action for a given time.

```
setTimeout(() => {
               setIsAuthenticated(true);
                }, 1000);

```

This is an example how I used the function in my project. Here there are two things we have to focus on:

- First, the action that has to be delayed in this case that is `setIsAuthenticated(true)`
- Second, how much time do we have to delay, here that is `1000`. Note that this is 1000 milli seconds milli means 1/1000. so here its 1000 milli seconds that is 1s.

  #### How this function helped me in my project

So was struggling with an issue in my project

##### Problem:

So while creating a new user, we navigate to the home page but the home page does'nt have the created user information.
