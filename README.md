# Project Overview

This is an application that helps business organizations to manage and organize the team. There will be two types of users , owner user who owns some business and worker users who are the workers hired by the owner user in their business.

## What can the user do?

- The owner users will be able to create an account by giving information about themselves and about their business.
- The owner user will be able to create different departments ( like the Kitchen and front House in a restaurant)  and will be able to create roles for each department ( like prep, line cook, and dishwasher in the Kitchen department).
- The owner user will be able to add team members to their team list by providing the email ( collected from the workers while hiring) and assigning appropriate departments and roles created by the owner user before.  
-  **Important:** Email address must be collected during the hiring process.
