So I learned how to navigate between screens in react-native, I searched a little bit about the type script, functional components,  while I was trying to understand why using jsx file instead of js and typescript is the super set of javascript where you can create your own type actually that is what I am using in the navigation too. Then I created how to create dynamic components like button in react native and passing the values as props.
